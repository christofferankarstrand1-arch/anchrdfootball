# ANCHRD League - Onboarding Implementation Plan

## Current Status

I've created the foundational components for the onboarding system:

### ‚úÖ Completed Components:

1. **AuthContext** (`/src/contexts/AuthContext.jsx`)
   - User authentication state management
   - Login/logout functionality
   - LocalStorage persistence
   - User profile updates

2. **OnboardingWizard** (`/src/components/onboarding/OnboardingWizard.jsx`)
   - User type selection (Talent vs Club)
   - Routing to appropriate onboarding flow
   - Progress tracking
   - Beautiful card-based selection UI

3. **TalentOnboarding** (`/src/components/onboarding/TalentOnboarding.jsx`)
   - 4-step onboarding process
   - Form validation
   - Skills and interests selection
   - Profile confirmation
   - Progress bar

4. **ClubOnboarding** (`/src/components/onboarding/ClubOnboarding.jsx`)
   - 4-step onboarding process
   - Club information collection
   - Contact person details
   - Form validation
   - Profile confirmation

### üì¶ Installed Dependencies:
- react-router-dom (for navigation)

## Recommendation: Simplified MVP Approach

Given the complexity of building a complete two-sided marketplace with:
- User authentication
- Profile pages
- Job posting system
- Application management
- Messaging
- File uploads

**I recommend we take a phased approach:**

### Phase 1: Core Onboarding (CURRENT)
‚úÖ User type selection
‚úÖ Multi-step forms
‚úÖ Data collection
‚úÖ Form validation

### Phase 2: Basic Routing & Dashboards (NEXT)
- Set up React Router
- Create basic dashboard for talents
- Create basic dashboard for clubs
- Simple navigation

### Phase 3: Profile Pages (SIMPLE VERSION)
- Display user/club information
- Edit profile functionality
- No image upload (use placeholder)

### Phase 4: Job Posting (SIMPLIFIED)
- Simple form for clubs to create opportunities
- Display opportunities on club dashboard
- Store in localStorage

### Phase 5: Application System (BASIC)
- "Apply" button on opportunities
- Simple application form
- Display applications in club dashboard
- Status management (pending/accepted/rejected)

## Alternative: Demo/Prototype Version

Instead of building a full backend-connected system, I can create a **high-fidelity prototype** that:

1. **Shows the complete user flow** from onboarding to application
2. **Uses mock data** stored in localStorage
3. **Demonstrates all key features** visually
4. **Can be easily connected** to a real backend later

This would include:
- ‚úÖ Complete onboarding (done)
- üìÑ Profile pages with mock data
- üìù Job posting form (saves to localStorage)
- üìã Application system (saves to localStorage)
- üé® Beautiful UI with all interactions
- üì± Fully responsive design

**Benefits:**
- Faster to implement
- Shows complete vision
- Easy to demo
- Can be upgraded to real backend later

**Time estimate:** 2-3 hours for complete prototype

## What Would You Like?

**Option A: Continue with full implementation**
- Will take significant time
- Requires many more components
- More complex state management
- Full feature set

**Option B: Create high-fidelity prototype**
- Faster implementation
- Shows complete vision
- All features demonstrated
- Uses mock data
- Can be upgraded later

**Option C: Focus on specific features**
- Pick 2-3 key features to fully implement
- Leave others as placeholders
- Balanced approach

Please let me know which direction you'd like to take, and I'll proceed accordingly!
